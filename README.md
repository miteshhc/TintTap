# TintTap

TintTap is just a color picker which uses super heavy things for very simple stuff.

⚠️ Note: This project is just a simple python script which uses heavy Qt stuff just to get a simple color picker. I really wanted a great color picker and that too ASAP. If you already have dependencies managed on your machine, you can grab the code and use it. Otherwise, don't bother.

## Key Features:
- **Effortless Color Selection:** With just a click, users can open the color picker dialog and choose from a vast range of colors.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** TintTap automatically copies the selected color's hexadecimal code to the clipboard, ready for immediate use.
- **Clean Interface:** The interface is stripped down to the essentials, providing an uncluttered and distraction-free user experience.
- **Overkill:** TintTap uses PySide6!!!

## Usage:

- Dependencies:  
git  
Python3  
PySide6  

- Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/veloXm/TintTap.git
```

- Navigate to cloned directory:
```
cd TintTap
```

- Run the `main.py`file using Python3.
```
py main.py
```
on Windows

```
python3 main.py
```
on Linux

#### Or just grab the code from main.py paste it in \*.py and just run it with python.
