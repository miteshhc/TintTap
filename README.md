# TintTap - Minimalistic Python Color Picker

TintTap is a minimalist color picker application crafted with Python and PySide6. This lightweight tool allows users to swiftly select colors and copy their hexadecimal codes to the clipboard. TintTap's simple interface makes color picking a breeze, without any unnecessary clutter.

⚠️ Note: This project is just a simple python script which uses heavy Qt stuff just to get a simple color picker. I really wanted a great color and that too ASAP. If you already have dependencies managed on your machine, you can grab the code and use it. Otherwise, don't bother.

## Key Features:
- **Effortless Color Selection:** With just a click, users can open the color picker dialog and choose from a vast range of colors.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** TintTap automatically copies the selected color's hexadecimal code to the clipboard, ready for immediate use.
- **Clean Interface:** The interface is stripped down to the essentials, providing an uncluttered and distraction-free user experience.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Built with Python and PySide6, TintTap runs seamlessly on various operating systems, offering versatility to users.
